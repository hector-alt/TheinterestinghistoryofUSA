                <h2>How it all Began</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="contenido">
                <p>America was discovered in 1492, but the first US territory would be founded on 1513 by Juan Ponce de León. Later, in 1565 Pedro Mendez de Aviles found San Agustin, (The oldest settlement of US ). <br> </br>

The spanish decide not to expand to the north because of the cold and because of the absence of gold in that area of the continent. So the spanish presence will be limited to Florida, south california where the cities of Los Angeles or San Francisco will be  founded,  and the territories that Mexico had when they became Independant.

United kingdom takes advantage of that situation to expand on the territories that Spain does not want and founds diferent colonies. Million of English migrate to these new lands between the 17-18 centuries. The english  colonies were : Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsilvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina del Norte, Carolina del Sur and Georgia.  <br>

In these colonies there weren’t only english, there was also Germans that founded Delaware and dutch that founded New Amsterdam (current “New York”). Meanwhile France was in Louisiana. <br> </br>

United kingdom and France start to compete to expand more their territories, so in 1754 the 7 years war starts, afecting North America and forcing to expend very hight taxes, the spanish help the French but united kingdom won and change Florida and Quebeq for Luisiana to the Spanish. <br>

The help given by the colonists were not rewarded and the taxes grow because of the protests. So the tensión between the colonists and the United kingdom became bigger. </p>

                <div class="contenido">
                  <p>Some Americans propose the idea of an independent America. In 1774, the first continental congress took place, the first colonists meeting against the British Crown and in favor of the Independence. In 1775 starts the war between United Kingdom and the colonists. The colonists met again in Philadelphia and took the function of a national government and create an army under the command of George Washington. Spain and France support the colonists and the United kingdom lose the war and their influence in the 13 colonies. <br>
                    The 4 of July of 1776, United kingdom signed the Independence of the colonists. <br>
                    The 13 colonies agreed to call “United States of America” and créate a federal government with a republican president and 2 legislative chambers. They also créate a new constitution, in 1787 and combocate alections in wich George Washington was elected as the first president of the USA. In 1803 USA bought Luisiana, In 1812 UK start a war trying to recover their territories but USA won again . Later USA conquered the “spanish Florida” taking advantage of Spain were fighting for their Independence against France.                   <br>
                  Thanks the economical development and the industrial revolution, USA expand to the far west motivated by the discovered of gold in california, this period of gold discovering and creation of a graet network of railways, canals and roads throughout the country was called us the gold rush. </p>

                    the slogan that the 13 colonies created to be representated was "No taxation without representation". They took taxes as illegitimate because they were not representated in the British parliament and also because in the Bill of rights was writen that the tax increase is prohibited with out parliament consent.  <br>
                  <br>  The colonists were paying more and more taxes.<br> <br>
